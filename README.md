# Welcome to the Arcade(WttA)
My first project for [Coding Dojo](https://www.codingdojo.com/) and as a developer.

A scalable hosting site for classic, 8-bit styled arcade games, such as, Snake.

## Visuals


## Installation
Using a terminal, clone the repository to the destination of your choice and type:

`git clone https://github.com/KimGreenbush/WttA__Welcome-to-the-Arcade.git`

Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible.

If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.
