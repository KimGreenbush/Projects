# Welcome to the Arcade(WttA)

My first project for [Coding Dojo](https://www.codingdojo.com/) and as a developer.

Designed to be scalable, it is build initially for browser usage but will be build out for primarily mobile usage in future updates.

WttA is a hosting site for classic, 8-bit styled arcade games, such as, Snake.

There is a login and registration for users to create a network. 

This network, along with the associated scores, is used to populate scoreboards and leaderboards.
