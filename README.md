# Welcome to the Arcade(WttA)

A scalable hosting site for classic, 8-bit styled arcade games, such as, Snake.

My inspiration for this project was my love of arcade games. I wanted to mimic the atmospher so the background is dark with bright accents to represent the game lights.

There's a registration system so players can save their scores and "friend" other players. Eventually I'd like to add a "friend area" for chatting and hanging out.

It's also fully responsive using **Bootstrap** so you can play on any practically any screen size.
